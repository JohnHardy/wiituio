INTRODUCTION
================
WiiTUIO is an application which stabilises the IR sources captured by a Wii Remote (Wiimote) and presents them as TUIO and Windows 7 Touch messages.

This project aims to improve the stability of the IR sources captured by the Wiimote using some thresholds and spatio-temporal classification. The application generates Windows 7 Touch messages and TUIO events using these stabilised contacts.

Each raw IR source captured by the Wiimote is either assigned to the best existing tracked source or generates a new tracker. This means that TUIO events can be generated from stable data without the jitter (namely, false-positives generated between two IR sources and the unordered source buffer) that occurs when trying to use the Wiimote to capture true multi-touch IR.

REQUIREMENTS
================
(1) Windows 7 is required in order to use generate touch events.
(2) The UniSoftHID driver used with MultiTouchVista.  The code to support touch events is based on (Multitouch.Driver.Logic) by Nesher. As such, I reccomend that you use the whole 'MultiTouchVista' package for better support.
    The UniSoftHID driver can be found bundled with 'MultiTouchVista' here:  http://multitouchvista.codeplex.com/releases/view/28979

NOTES
================
Still reading?  There are a couple of things you should know before using this software:
(1) You need to click Connect first.
(2) Ensure you click calibrate at least once after you have created a connection.
